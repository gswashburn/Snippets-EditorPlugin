# Snippets Editor Plugin Script

An editor plugin for Godot Engine 3.x to manage code snippets in your projects.

Snippets are small pieces of code you use over and over in your game development lifecycle.
This plugin allows you to copy and paste them to your current game script editor. It also allows for the
addition of new snippets to the list by copying code from the script editor and pasting it as a snippet file.

Changes to this version as described in the original readme:

> v1.1 Adds Internal Editor to right mouse click on Code Snippet
